# WebdriverIO Browser Drivers Monorepo

This monorepo contains Node.js wrappers for managing browser driver binaries ([Geckodriver](https://github.com/webdriverio/driver/blob/main/packages/node-geckodriver/README.md), [Edgedriver](https://github.com/webdriverio/driver/blob/main/packages/node-edgedriver/README.md), and [Safaridriver](https://github.com/webdriverio/driver/blob/main/packages/node-safaridriver/README.md)). These packages facilitate downloading, starting, and managing driver server processes for [WebdriverIO](https://webdriver.io) and other test automation frameworks.

## Compatibility

WebdriverIO installs the driver packages it needs through `@wdio/utils`. If you only use WebdriverIO, you do not install them yourself.

| WebdriverIO | `geckodriver` | `edgedriver` | `safaridriver` | Node.js | `@wdio/logger` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | 8.x | 8.x | 3.x | 22.19.0 or newer | 10, peer dependency |
| 9 | 6.x or 7.x | 6.x or 7.x | 1.x or 2.x | 20 or newer (`safaridriver`: 18) | 9, dependency |

From geckodriver 8 and edgedriver 8, `@wdio/logger` is a peer dependency, so the drivers use the logger of your WebdriverIO install. A second copy of the logger empties the WebdriverIO log file (`outputDir`).

### Upgrading to geckodriver 8, edgedriver 8 and safaridriver 3

- Use Node.js 22.19.0 or newer.
- If you use `geckodriver` or `edgedriver` without WebdriverIO and install with Yarn, add `@wdio/logger` to your dependencies. npm and pnpm install it for you.
- `geckodriver` no longer reads `GECKODRIVER_FILEPATH`. Use `GECKODRIVER_PATH`.
- `require()` now returns every export of the package, for example `findEdgePath` from `edgedriver`, with CommonJS types.
- With `require('safaridriver')`, `start()` returns the `ChildProcess` and `stop()` returns nothing, as in ESM: before, both returned a Promise. `await start()` still works; `start().then(...)` does not.
- `HTTPS_PROXY` and `HTTP_PROXY` now apply to downloads; 6.x and 7.x ignored them. If a proxy is set in your environment but the CDN must be reached directly, add its host to `NO_PROXY`.
- `edgedriver`'s `start()` resolves to a `ChildProcess` (it was typed `ChildProcessWithoutNullStreams`): its `stdout` and `stderr` are `null` when you pass `spawnOpts: { stdio: 'ignore' }`.
- `safaridriver` now pipes the driver output like the other drivers: read `stdout` and `stderr`, or pass `spawnOpts: { stdio: 'ignore' }`. Before, the output was buffered and the driver was killed after 1 MB of it.
- The `edgedriver` and `geckodriver` CLIs exit with code 1 when a signal kills the driver; they exited with 0.
- On Windows, `EDGEDRIVER_AUTO_INSTALL` and `GECKODRIVER_AUTO_INSTALL` now download the driver during the install; before, the install always skipped the download there.
- `findEdgePath()` on Windows returns `undefined` when Edge is not installed, as on macOS and Linux; it threw.
- `spawnOpts` is a new option of `edgedriver` and `safaridriver`. The rest of the API, the CLI and the options did not change.

## Installation

Install the driver package needed for your target browser:

```bash
# Firefox
npm install geckodriver --save-dev

# Microsoft Edge
npm install edgedriver --save-dev

# Safari (macOS only)
npm install safaridriver --save-dev

```

---

## CLI Usage

Drivers can be executed directly using `npx`:

```bash
# Start Geckodriver
npx geckodriver --port=4444

# Start Edgedriver
npx edgedriver --port=4444

# Start Safaridriver (macOS)
npx safaridriver --port=4444

```

### Environment Variables & Global Installation Setup

#### Auto-Installation Flags

By default, binaries download when initialized via CLI or API. To download them during `npm install`, pass the respective flag:

* **Geckodriver:** `GECKODRIVER_AUTO_INSTALL=1 npm i`
* **Edgedriver:** `EDGEDRIVER_AUTO_INSTALL=1 npm i`

The download runs in each package's `postinstall` script. pnpm 10 or newer and Bun run it only for packages you approve (`pnpm approve-builds`, or `trustedDependencies` in Bun), and recent npm versions warn until you approve them with `npm install-scripts approve <package>`. If the download fails, the install does not fail: the driver then downloads on first use.

#### Version Pinning & Custom Sources

* **Custom Driver Version:**
* `GECKODRIVER_VERSION="0.31.0"`
* `EDGEDRIVER_VERSION="114.0.1823.18"`
* `EDGE_BINARY_PATH=/path/to/msedge`: the Edge binary whose version selects the Edgedriver download when `EDGEDRIVER_VERSION` is not set. `findEdgePath()` returns it.


* **Custom CDN URL:**
* `GECKODRIVER_CDNURL=https://INTERNAL_CDN/geckodriver/download`
* `EDGEDRIVER_CDNURL=https://INTERNAL_CDN/edgedriver/download`


* **CDN credentials:** a CDN URL can carry them, for example `https://user:password@INTERNAL_CDN`. They are sent as a Basic `Authorization` header and kept out of the logs; percent-encode special characters (`@` is `%40`, `%` is `%25`). Use `https://`: over `http://`, Basic credentials travel in clear text. A redirect to another host does not receive them.

* **HTTP/HTTPS Proxy:** `HTTPS_PROXY` and `HTTP_PROXY` apply to downloads, and `NO_PROXY` lists the hosts that skip the proxy. The lower-case forms work too and win over the upper-case ones. A dispatcher set with undici's `setGlobalDispatcher` (as in the [WebdriverIO proxy docs](https://webdriver.io/docs/proxy)) wins over these variables.

#### Windows Setup (`selenium-webdriver` note)

When installing `geckodriver` or `edgedriver` globally on Windows, `selenium-webdriver` expects the `.exe` extension in PATH. You can create a symlink in your global npm binary directory:

```cmd
mklink %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\npm\geckodriver.exe %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\geckodriver\geckodriver.exe

```

---

## Programmatic Usage

All driver packages export methods to programmatically control browser driver instances within Node.js scripts.

### ESM Example (`geckodriver` / `edgedriver`)

```typescript
import { start } from 'geckodriver'; // or 'edgedriver'
import { remote } from 'webdriverio';
import waitPort from 'wait-port';

// 1. Start driver process
const cp = await start({ port: 4444 });

// 2. Wait for driver port to open
await waitPort({ port: 4444 });

// 3. Connect WebdriverIO session
// without `port`, WebdriverIO starts a driver of its own; geckodriver accepts
// `127.0.0.1` but not `localhost` (the default) unless you pass `allowHosts`
const browser = await remote({
  hostname: '127.0.0.1',
  port: 4444,
  capabilities: {
    browserName: 'firefox' // or 'MicrosoftEdge'
  }
});

await browser.url('https://webdriver.io');
console.log(await browser.getTitle());

// 4. Terminate process when finished
cp.kill();

```

### ESM Example (`safaridriver`)

```typescript
import safaridriver from 'safaridriver';
import { remote } from 'webdriverio';
import waitPort from 'wait-port';

// 1. Start Safaridriver server
safaridriver.start({ port: 4444 });

// 2. Wait for driver port to open
await waitPort({ port: 4444 });

// 3. Connect WebdriverIO session
// without `port`, WebdriverIO starts a driver of its own
const browser = await remote({
  port: 4444,
  capabilities: {
    browserName: 'safari'
  }
});

await browser.url('https://webdriver.io');
console.log(await browser.getTitle());

// 4. Stop Safaridriver process
safaridriver.stop();

```
